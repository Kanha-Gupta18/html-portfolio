<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>

<p> As you would have guessed from the home page, my name is Kanha Gupta, currently I am a student
  at BITS Pilani. I come from Jammu, and my schooling was completed from Jodhamal Public School 
  and Birla Open Minds International School. 
</p>

<p>I am learning Web Development, and this website contains the projects I've built so far 
  in my journey. It is very simple right now, but with time, I shall make changes to make it better.
